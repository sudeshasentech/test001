						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Purchase&#44; Sale and Use of Product&#46;</strong>
							These Terms and Conditions govern the purchase of a vaccine or other
							product (“Product”) from PaxVax, Inc. (“PaxVax”). Any customer who purchases Product from PaxVax
							pursuant to a written agreement other than these Terms and Conditions and Product orders submitted hereunder
							is not eligible to purchase Product under these Terms and Conditions (unless otherwise specified in such other
							written agreement). Orders submitted by customers who are party to (or who may participate under) any other
							written agreement with PaxVax relating to the sale or purchase of Product are subject to the terms and
							conditions set forth in the other written agreement and not herein (unless otherwise specified in such other
							written agreement). No customer who purchases Product hereunder may market, promote, administer or use
							Product for the benefit of persons or entities located outside the United States, or where it ought reasonably to
							be aware that the ultimate destination for Product is outside the United States.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Product Ordering&#59; Delivery&#46;</strong>
							Each customer may create a direct purchase account by calling PaxVax Customer
							Service at 800-533-5899 and may order Product (a) by calling PaxVax Customer Service at 800-533-5899 or
							faxing order forms supplied by PaxVax to 800-392-9490 or (b) via any e-commerce website maintained by
							PaxVax or any third party engaged by it for which PaxVax notifies the customer. Product purchased hereunder
							will consist of units containing the number of doses of Product specified in the applicable Product prescribing
							information. Each order submitted by a customer is subject to PaxVax’s confirmation of the customer’s valid
							state license number and authorizations and the customer’s creditworthiness. PaxVax will use reasonable
							commercial efforts to deliver Product ordered by a customer to the destination designated by the customer in
							the customer’s direct purchase account. PaxVax will be responsible for all costs of shipment of Product to the
							customer. PaxVax assumes no obligation to comply with any special shipping requests made by a customer,
							including, without limitation, any request to deliver Product by a specified date. PaxVax is responsible for
							obtaining all licenses required to deliver Product to the specified destination. PaxVax’s obligation to deliver
							Product is subject at all times to any superseding requirement imposed by any governmental authority and to
							the condition that PaxVax is able to manufacture a sufficient supply of Product to meet the demands of all of
							its customers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a natural disaster or shortage of
							Product or any other event giving rise to a government requirement, or in the event that for any reason PaxVax
							is otherwise unable to supply all or any portion of Product ordered by a customer, PaxVax will notify the
							customer and be relieved (without incurring any liability) of all obligation to supply or deliver Product ordered
							by the customer.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Payment Terms and Instructions.</strong>
							Customers are obligated to pay for Product by, at PaxVax’s discretion, (i)
							credit card processed at the time of shipment of the purchased Product by PaxVax or its designee, or (ii) on the
							payment due date specified in the invoice delivered by PaxVax with respect to the purchased Product by any
							method described in the invoice. Interest will be charged on overdue amounts at a rate equal to one and onehalf
							percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, until the date
							payment is received by PaxVax.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Product Price.</strong>
							The price for Product is as established by PaxVax and set forth from time to time in the direct
							purchase account established by a customer and excludes surcharges for any excise or other taxes or
							assessments levied on Product. Amounts invoiced to and payable by customers will reflect all such surcharges.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Inspection of Product by Customers; Right to Return Product.</strong>
							Customers must, within 72 hours after
							delivery of Product, conduct a physical inspection of the packaged Product and notify PaxVax of any issue or
							physical damage that is apparent from the inspection by calling PaxVax Customer Service at 800-533-5899. If
							a customer fails to give the notice, then the customer will be conclusively presumed to have accepted the
							shipment and PaxVax will have no liability to the customer for any defects that could have been identified by
							the inspection or for any discrepancies between the shipment received and the amount of Product ordered by
							the customer. Any defect or damage to Product that is not identifiable from a physical inspection will remain
							grounds for rejection of Product if the customer notifies PaxVax in writing within 72 hours following
							discovery of the defect or damage. Upon receipt of the notice from a customer, PaxVax will conduct an
							investigation and if PaxVax agrees with the customer’s determination, (i) PaxVax will use reasonable
							commercial efforts to supply replacement Product to the customer, or if no replacement Product can be
							supplied, PaxVax will issue a credit note or refund to the customer for the Product, and (ii) the customer must
							ship the Product in accordance with instructions provided by PaxVax. If PaxVax, in its sole discretion,
							determines that no defect or damage to the Product exists, then the customer must accept delivery of the
							Product and pay the invoiced price for the Product (in which event PaxVax will not be deemed to be in breach
							of these Terms and Conditions or have any further liability to the customer with respect to the alleged defect or
							damage). In the event a customer has not used or administered Product as of the expiration date of the Product,
							the customer will not be entitled to any refund but will be entitled to a credit note in accordance with the terms
							and conditions set forth in PaxVax’s return policy then in effect. Other than as set forth in this Section and in
							such return policy, customers may not return Product.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Passage of Title; Risk of Loss.</strong>
							All orders for Product are shipped F.O.B. Destination. Title to Product and risk
							of loss of each shipment of Product will pass to the customer upon delivery to the destination designated by the
							customer in the customer’s direct purchase account.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Limitations on Marketing.</strong>
							Customers may not sell, promote or market Product in a manner that is, or engage in
							activities or efforts that are, disparaging or otherwise damaging to PaxVax or any Product brand. Customers
							may not hold themselves out as representatives or agents of PaxVax or otherwise as being entitled to bind
							PaxVax in any way, and customers must make clear in all dealings with other persons or entities that they are
							not acting as agents of PaxVax.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Covenants of Customers.</strong> Each customer agrees that it will:
							<ul class=" sublist">
								<li class="padding_bottom_10 padding_top_10">
									obtain and maintain all licenses and approvals that may be necessary for the use, administration, storage
									and marketing of Product, as applicable to the customer, in the United States;
								</li>
								<li class="padding_bottom_10">
									not initiate any contact with any governmental authority in relation to Product without the express written
									consent of PaxVax, unless required by applicable law, and insofar as requests for information or
									correspondence in relation to Product are made of a customer by a governmental authority, unless
									otherwise required by law, the customer must consult with PaxVax and keep PaxVax fully apprised of all
									communications;
								</li>
								<li class="padding_bottom_10">
									not make any representation nor give any warranties other than those printed on Product packaging,
									including the Product prescribing information;
								</li>
								<li  class="padding_bottom_10">
									not administer or use Product for indications not approved by a governmental authority or listed on Product
									packaging, including the Product prescribing information;
								</li>
								<li  class="padding_bottom_10">
									observe and comply with any storage, handling, stock control and operational practices and procedures of
									PaxVax in effect from time to time or as required by any governmental authority or applicable law;
								</li>
								<li  class="padding_bottom_10">
									observe and comply with procedures for adverse event reporting and provision of medical information of
									PaxVax in effect from time to time;
								</li>
								<li  class="padding_bottom_10">
									execute any recall or withdrawal of Product from the market in accordance with procedures of PaxVax in
									effect from time to time; and
								</li>
								<li  class="padding_bottom_10">
									comply with applicable law or any other applicable requirements imposed by a governmental authority
									relating to Product.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties; Withdrawal of Product Approval.</strong>
							PaxVax makes no representation or warranty
and gives no undertakings in relation to the grant (by any date or at all) of the licenses or authorizations
required to market, manufacture or release for export Product lawfully in the United States, or the maintenance
of the licenses and authorizations, and customers will have no claim against PaxVax arising out of any failure
to obtain the grant or renewal of, or otherwise maintain, the licenses and authorizations. PaxVax will promptly
notify customers in writing of any withdrawal of a Product’s United States Food and Drug Administration
approval or of a Product’s material noncompliance with United States Food and Drug Administration
standards.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Modification of Product.</strong>
							Subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, PaxVax may, in its sole
discretion, modify Product as it deems appropriate or necessary or as may be required by any governmental
authority, including changes in design, production or packaging of Product (including the applicable Product
prescribing information) or withdrawal of Product in response to a governmental authority action, without
liability to customers of any kind.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Use of Trademarks; Limitations on Use of Intellectual Property.</strong>
							Customers may not use any Product
trademark for any purpose, or use any other trade name or trademark or other intellectual property rights of
PaxVax, other than as expressly necessary to exercise their rights and perform their obligations under these
Terms and Conditions. Customers must ensure that each reference to and use of any Product trademark is
accompanied by an acknowledgement that it is a registered trademark of PaxVax. Upon request by PaxVax,
each customer will deliver to PaxVax copies of examples of the customer’s use of a Product trademark in order
to assess compliance with this Section. Customers will not acquire any rights in respect of any trade names,
trademarks or other intellectual property rights of PaxVax (including any Product trademark) or of the goodwill
associated therewith and all the rights and goodwill are, and will at all times remain, vested in PaxVax.
Customers may not: (a) make any modification to Product or its packaging or prescribing information; (b) alter,
obscure, remove or tamper with any trademarks, markings, numbers, labels, indication of the source of origin,
or other means of identification used on, or in relation to, Product; (c) use any Product trademark in any way
which might materially prejudice its distinctiveness or validity or the goodwill of PaxVax therein; or (d) use or
make any application for registration in the United States of any trademarks or trade names so resembling any
trademark or trade name of PaxVax as to be likely to cause confusion or deception.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Government Payment Programs.</strong>
							Each customer represents and warrants that neither it, nor any individual
employed by it, is currently included in the Department of Health and Human Services/Office of Inspector
General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities or in the General Services Administration List of Parties
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs. Each customer must notify PaxVax
immediately in writing if it or any individual employed by it is excluded or becomes reasonably subject to
exclusion from a Federal healthcare program. If a customer or any individual employed by it is excluded or
becomes reasonably subject to the exclusion from a Federal healthcare program, PaxVax may immediately
terminate any outstanding order submitted by the customer and to refuse acceptance of any further orders from
the customer.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Confidential Information.</strong>
							Each customer agrees that any and all information it obtains regarding PaxVax,
including pricing information and all other contract information, is confidential information of PaxVax. Each
customer (a) will not disclose PaxVax’s confidential information to any third party without the prior written
consent of PaxVax (except as required to comply with law or court order); (b) may disclose PaxVax’s
confidential information to its employees only to the extent that the employees are reasonably required by their
duties to have knowledge of the confidential information, and provided that the employees are obligated to
hold the confidential information in confidence and to otherwise comply with these Terms and Conditions; (c)
will not hold PaxVax or its affiliates or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents liable for any
errors or omissions in PaxVax’s confidential information; and (d) will use reasonable care to safeguard
PaxVax’s confidential information and will make no misuse of the confidential information. Each customer
acknowledges that any and all confidential information disclosed by PaxVax to the customer is and remains the
property of PaxVax. PaxVax makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and
completeness of its confidential information. Each customer agrees to return any PaxVax confidential
information promptly upon written request and to retain no copies or excerpts thereof. Each customer’s
obligations under this Section will remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the date that the last order
of Product was submitted by the customer to PaxVax.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Force Majeure.</strong>
							PaxVax has no liability to customers for failure or delay in the performance of any obligation
hereunder to the extent and for the period that the performance is prevented by reason of Force Majeure if
PaxVax gives written notice of the Force Majeure to the affected customer within thirty (30) days of the
occurrence of the Force Majeure. If the performance by PaxVax is prevented for a period exceeding ninety
(90) days from the date of the notice, the affected customer may terminate all outstanding orders submitted by
the customer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not affect the customer’s obligations to pay amounts
invoiced for Product previously delivered) by providing written notice to PaxVax, and thereafter (as well as
during the period from the occurrence of the Force Majeure through and after the termination) PaxVax will
have no liability to the customer under these Terms and Conditions or the cancelled order(s). As used herein,
“Force Majeure” means any cause preventing or hindering the performance of these Terms and Conditions or
any orders arising from or attributable to acts, events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of
PaxVax, including epidemics or pandemics of disease, acts of God, shortage of materials, war (declared or
undeclared), labor disputes, accidents, acts of terrorism, fire, breakdown of machinery, government requisition
or impoundment or other acts of any governmental authority, riot or civil commotion and any other acts, events
or circumstances beyond PaxVax’s reasonable control.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Warranties of PaxVax.</strong>
							PaxVax warrants that at the time of delivery to the destination designated by the
customer in the customer’s direct purchase account, Product ordered by the customer (a) will materially
conform to the quality, identity, and strength standards of Product as described in its packaging, including its
prescribing information; (b) will not be adulterated or misbranded (within the meaning of the U.S. Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as in effect at the time of delivery) and will not be prohibited from being
introduced into interstate commerce; and (c) will have been manufactured in substantial compliance with thencurrent
good manufacturing practices and any other applicable laws or regulations. This Section sets forth
PaxVax’s sole and limited warranties with respect to Product delivered to customers. To the maximum extent
allowed by law, except as unambiguously and expressly set forth in this Section, PaxVax specifically
disclaims, and each customer expressly waives and releases PaxVax from, all other warranties, conditions and
terms regarding or relating to Product that may have been provided to the customer or otherwise that might
have effect between the customer and PaxVax or be implied into these Terms and Conditions, a Product order,
or any other collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise and whether express, implied or
otherwise, including all implied warranties, conditions or terms of merchantability, quality, fitness for a
particular purpose and non-infringement. The warranties contained in this Section will not apply to any
Uncovered Product.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Limitation on Warranties of PaxVax.</strong>
							PaxVax is not liable to any customer, and each customer expressly
waives and releases PaxVax from any liability, with respect to Product (“Uncovered Product”) that (a) has been
tampered with or in any way altered or modified after delivery to the customer’s designated destination; (b) has
been subject to misuse, negligence or accident after delivery to the customer’s designated destination; (c) has
been stored, handled, maintained, administered or used in a manner contrary to regulatory requirements, the
Product packaging or prescribing information or PaxVax’s instructions, or otherwise not as originally intended,
after delivery to the customer’s designated destination; or (d) has passed its expiration date.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Limitation on Damages.</strong>
							To the maximum extent allowed by law, in no event will PaxVax be liable for any
indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages, or other damages relating to loss of use, income or profit,
or loss or damage to person or property, arising out of or in connection with the marketing, sale or use of
Product, including damages resulting from any negligence or breach of any obligation imposed on any
customer. The exclusive remedy of a customer ordering product from PaxVax for claims with respect to these
Terms and Conditions or any orders submitted by the customer will be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 18 below.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Indemnification by PaxVax.</strong>
							PaxVax will defend, indemnify and hold harmless each customer ordering Product
and the customer’s directors, officers, employees and agents (each, an “Indemnitee”) from and against any and
all claims, demands, actions, losses, expenses, damages, liabilities, costs and judgments (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) (“Damages”) directly arising out of any material breach of any warranty set forth in Section 15
above (as limited therein with respect to Uncovered Product) or any material default by PaxVax under these
Terms and Conditions, provided that PaxVax will not, in any case, be obligated to defend, indemnify or hold
harmless any Indemnitee from any the Damages that result from any acts or omissions of an Indemnitee
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Damages that result in Product becoming an Uncovered Product).
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Indemnification by Customers.</strong>
							Each customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless PaxVax and its
affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all Damages
directly arising out of (a) any infringement by the customer of any intellectual property rights of PaxVax or
third parties; (b) any material breach of any representation or warranty of the customer made in these Terms
and Conditions or any material default by the customer hereunder or under any order submitted by the
customer; and (c) any act or omission by the customer or its directors, officers, employees or agents with
respect to any Product resulting in a Product becoming an Uncovered Product.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Survival of Indemnification Obligations.</strong>
							The indemnification obligations under Sections 18 and 19 above will
survive for a period of three (3) years following the date on which the applicable order for Product is submitted
by the customer.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Insurance.</strong>
							Each customer ordering Product from PaxVax must maintain, for no less than three (3) years from
the date of the last order submitted by the customer, the type and amount of insurance coverage that are normal
and customary for entities similarly situated insuring the customer against any liabilities arising under the
warranties and indemnities made by the customer herein as are reasonably insurable. Each customer must at
all times comply with all insurance requirements of any governmental authority and applicable law.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Termination.</strong>
							In addition to all other rights of termination specified herein, PaxVax may terminate any orders
submitted by a customer by notice to the customer, having immediate effect, (a) if the customer commits a
material breach of any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions or the order, and in the case of a
material breach capable of remedy (it being agreed that non-payment is not subject to remedy), the customer
fails to remedy the breach within ten (10) days of receipt of a notice giving particulars of the breach and
requiring it to be remedied; (b) any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar
proceeding or event with respect to the customer and its creditors, or the carrying on of the customer’s
business; or (c) if as a result of any action taken by a governmental authority, it becomes commercially
impracticable or impossible for PaxVax (as determined in its sole discretion) to supply Product ordered by the
customer.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Consequences of Termination.</strong>
							Upon the termination or expiration, for any reason, of an outstanding order
submitted by a customer and/or these Terms and Conditions, (a) the customer will have no claim against
PaxVax for compensation for loss of rights to use, administer, market or promote Product, loss of goodwill or
any similar loss; (b) Sections 3, 4, 9, 11, 13 and 15-28 will continue in full force in accordance with their terms
for a period of three (3) years from the date of termination (or any longer period as may be specified herein);
and (c) all outstanding unpaid invoices will become immediately due and payable and PaxVax will have no
further obligation to deliver Product. Termination or expiration of an outstanding order will be without
prejudice to any rights that have accrued to the benefit of a party prior to the termination or expiration.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Notice.</strong>
							All notices, requests, demands and other communications which are required or may be given hereunder

						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Governing Law.</strong>
							These Terms and Conditions will be governed and interpreted under the laws of the State of
California, without giving effect to any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise require
or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Any dispute arising hereunder will be subject to
final and binding arbitration in San Mateo County, California before the American Arbitration Association
under its then applicable rules for commercial disputes. The parties hereby agree to waive their right to have
any dispute resolved in a court of law by a judge or jury.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong>
							These Terms and Conditions and each order for Product submitted by a customer contain all
the terms which PaxVax and the customer have agreed to in relation to the purchase of Product. Each
customer agrees that it is not relying on, and will have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation,
warranty, collateral contract or other assurance of any person or entity other than those expressly set out as a
warranty in these Terms and Conditions and the applicable order, and that, except as otherwise provided
herein, the only remedy available to it for breach of the warranties set forth herein is for breach of contract
under these Terms and Conditions.
						</li>
						<li class="padding_bottom_10"><strong>Assignment.</strong>
							Customers may not assign or delegate these Terms and Conditions or any of the rights or duties
arising hereunder without the prior written consent of PaxVax and any attempt to so assign or delegate will be

the customer.
